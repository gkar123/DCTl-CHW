Introduction

This project implements the Deep Convolutional Transfer Learning-based Crossover Harbor Whisker Seal (DCTL-CHW) algorithm for automated detection of diabetic eye diseases using fundus images. The approach integrates transfer learning with GoogLeNet and Harbor Whisker Seal Optimization Algorithm to enhance classification accuracy.

Features

Image Preprocessing: Cropping, contrast enhancement, flipping, normalization, and resizing.

Data Augmentation: Random transformations to improve model generalization.

Feature Extraction: Autoencoder-based feature selection.

Deep Learning Model: Transfer learning with GoogLeNet.

Optimization: Harbor Whisker Seal optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Dataset

The code utilizes the DIARETDB1 dataset for detecting diabetic retinopathy and other eye diseases.
